# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Project

Introduction: This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to gain insights into the performance of loan applications and disbursements. The analysis includes key metrics like total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. Using MS SQL Server for data querying and Power BI for visualization, the project delivers an interactive dashboard to monitor loan KPIs and trends.

Key Features:
SQL Queries for Accuracy: Complex SQL queries were used to increase the accuracy of data analysis, ensuring reliable results when calculating key metrics like loan applications, funded amounts, and received payments.

Power BI & DAX Functions: In Power BI, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions were implemented to create dynamic calculations, such as Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) analysis of KPIs.

Data Visualizations: The dashboard includes detailed visualizations like line charts for trends, bar charts for loan purposes, and treemaps for homeownership impact, providing a comprehensive view of loan performance.


Tools Used: Power BI Desktop, SQL Server Management Studio
